Contributors Policy
Project Status: Pre-Release

This project is currently in pre-release, which means it is under rapid and active development and may undergo significant changes frequently. While we welcome contributions, contributors should be aware of the following guidelines and the fast-evolving nature of the project.

How to Contribute

    Fork the repository: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

    Work on a feature branch: Make your changes in a branch named according to the feature or bugfix you are addressing (e.g., feature/awesome-feature or bugfix/fix-issue-123).

    Write clear commit messages: Your commit messages should be concise but descriptive enough to understand the purpose of the change.

    Submit a pull request: Once your work is ready, submit a pull request (PR) against the main branch, ensuring:
        Your changes are well-documented.
        You provide details about the purpose of the PR, what it changes, and any context that might be relevant.
        Your code passes any existing tests (or you include new tests where applicable).

Code Quality and Reviews

    Coding Standards: Please follow the coding style and conventions used in the project. Reviewing existing code is highly recommended to understand the rapidly evolving patterns and practices in use.
    Automated Checks: Ensure your contributions pass any automated checks (e.g., linting, tests) before submitting.
    Review Process: PRs will be reviewed on a best-effort basis. Due to the fast pace of development, not all contributions may be accepted immediately. Significant changes may happen in the codebase during the review process, which could impact the relevance or feasibility of your PR.

Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

By contributing to this repository, you agree that your contributions can be used under the project’s license.
Communication

    Expect Rapid Evolution: Significant reworking of the core architecture and features is common, and your PR may be overtaken by events or not align with the intended future architecture.
    Early Discussion is Key: For major contributions or feature ideas, it is strongly recommended to first create an issue or engage in discussions to gather feedback before submitting a PR. This reduces the likelihood of your work becoming outdated during development shifts.
    Stay Updated: Keep an eye on the project’s main branch and recent commits, as frequent changes may impact your contributions.
    Collaborative Etiquette: Be respectful and cooperative in all interactions, whether in issues, discussions, or PR comments.

Known Limitations and Priorities

Given the pre-release and rapid development status:

    The codebase is evolving quickly, which may require you to update or revise your contributions as the project advances.
    Priorities might shift frequently, leading to re-evaluation of feature sets or changes in direction.
    Your PR might be impacted by architectural shifts, leading to delays or potential non-acceptance due to incompatibility with the latest developments.

Recognition

All contributors will be acknowledged in the project documentation (once created).
Future Updates

This contributors policy will be updated as the project transitions out of pre-release and into a more stable phase.
