## Security Policy

Project Status: Pre-Release

This project is currently in a pre-release state, which means it is still under active development. As a result, security updates and bug fixes are provided on a best-effort basis.
Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, we encourage you to help us address it by following these steps:

    Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly: Please report any potential vulnerabilities privately via email at john@foundryside.dev or through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. 

    Provide as much detail as possible: Include information about the affected version, how to reproduce the issue, and any suggested fixes.

Response and Fixes

Due to the pre-release status of this project:

    We will review reported issues and work on fixes based on priority and available resources.
    We cannot guarantee specific timelines for responses or fixes.
    Security updates will be applied as soon as practical, but are not subject to a fixed release schedule.

Future Updates

As the project matures and transitions to a stable release, the security policy will be updated to reflect a more structured approach to vulnerability management, including defined response timelines and release cycles.
