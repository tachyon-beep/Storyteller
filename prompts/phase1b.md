## Instructions

Complete the following steps in order:

1. **Geographic Overview**
   - Based on the core concept, design the broad geography of the world.
   - **Output**: A paragraph describing the major geographic features (continents, oceans, mountain ranges, etc.) and their relation to the core concept.

2. **Climate Systems**
   - Develop the climate patterns of the world, considering how they might influence culture and conflict.
   - **Output**: A list of 3-4 major climate zones, each with:
     - A brief description of the climate.
     - How it relates to the geographic features.
     - Potential impact on inhabitants or story elements.

3. **Flora Development**
   - Create unique plant life that reflects the world's concept and themes.
   - **Output**: Descriptions of 3-5 notable plant species, including:
     - Name and physical description.
     - Habitat and distribution.
     - Any special properties or significance to the world.

4. **Fauna Creation**
   - Design animal life (mundane or fantastic) that inhabits the world.
   - **Output**: Descriptions of 3-5 notable animal species, including:
     - Name and physical description.
     - Habitat and behavior.
     - Relationship to the world's inhabitants or themes.

5. **Natural Resources**
   - Identify key natural resources that shape the world's development and potential conflicts.
   - **Output**: A list of 3-4 crucial natural resources, each with:
     - Name and description.
     - Locations or methods of extraction.
     - Importance to the world's inhabitants or potential source of conflict.

6. **Environmental Challenges**
   - Develop environmental issues or phenomena that impact the world.
   - **Output**: Descriptions of 2-3 significant environmental challenges, including:
     - Nature of the challenge.
     - Areas or populations affected.
     - Potential narrative implications.

7. **Sensory Landscape**
   - Create a sensory palette that brings the physical world to life.
   - **Output**: A list of distinctive sensory experiences, including:
     - 3 unique sights.
     - 2 characteristic sounds.
     - 2 notable scents.
     - 1 distinctive taste associated with the world.
     - 1 unique tactile experience.

8. **Physical World Integration**
   - Reflect on how the physical world elements support and enhance the core concept and themes.
   - **Output**: A paragraph explaining how the physical world reinforces or challenges the established themes and concept.

9. **Change History**
   - Document any significant changes or decisions made during this phase.
   - **Output**: A list of any major alterations to the initial concepts, including the rationale behind each change.

10. **Generate Structured List**
    - Before writing the list, write: "%%% LIST START %%%"
    - Using the physical world information you've created, organize it into a structured text list format. Follow these guidelines:
      - Use indentation to show hierarchy (use spaces, not tabs)
      - Use bullet points (- ) for list items
      - Use clear, descriptive labels for each section
      - Ensure all information from previous steps is included
    - After writing the list, write: "%%% LIST END %%%"
    - After completing this step, write: "Phase 1B Complete. Output:"

Your response should only include the output from step 10 and should start like this:
