## Instructions

Complete the following steps in order:

1. **System Overview**
   - Describe the fundamental nature of technology or magic in your world.
   - **Output**: A paragraph explaining whether your world is primarily technological, magical, or a blend of both, and the basic principles governing these systems.

2. **Key Technologies or Magical Disciplines**
   - Detail the most important or prevalent technologies or types of magic.
   - **Output**: For each key technology or magical discipline (3-4), provide:
     - Name and brief description
     - Capabilities and limitations
     - Impact on daily life or society

3. **System Rules and Limitations**
   - Establish the rules and limitations of your technology or magic system.
   - **Output**: List 4-5 fundamental rules or limitations, each including:
     - The rule or limitation
     - Reasoning behind it
     - Consequences of breaking or circumventing it

4. **Distribution and Access**
   - Explain how technology or magic is distributed and accessed in your world.
   - **Output**: A paragraph describing:
     - Who has access to technology or magic
     - How it's regulated or controlled
     - Any disparities in access and their societal impacts

5. **Interaction with the Physical World**
   - Describe how technology or magic interacts with the physical aspects of your world.
   - **Output**: 2-3 examples of how technology or magic has shaped or is shaped by the physical environment.

6. **Integration with Core Concept**
   - Explain how the technology/magic system relates to the core concept and themes established in Phase 1A.
   - **Output**: A paragraph describing how this system reinforces or challenges the fundamental aspects of your world.

7. **Change History**
   - Document any significant changes or decisions made during this phase.
   - **Output**: A list of any major alterations to the initial concepts, including the rationale behind each change.

8. **Generate Structured List**
   - Before writing the list, write: "%%% LIST START %%%"
   - Using the technology/magic system information you've created, organize it into a structured text list format.
   - After writing the list, write: "%%% LIST END %%%"
   - After completing this step, write: "Phase 1F Complete. Output:"

Your response should only include the output from step 8 and should start like this:
%%% LIST START %%%
